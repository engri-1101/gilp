Quickstart Guide
================

This guide is the perfect place to begin exploring GILP. First, we walk through
the installation of GILP. Next, we provide a breif introduction to linear
programming and the simplex algorithm. Afterwards, we will learn how to
visualize the included examples LPs and create LPs of our own! Lastly, we will
explore different solver parameters that can be set when running simplex.
