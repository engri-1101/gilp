Development
===========

This guide is aimed towards those who have prior knowledge of linear programming
and the simplex algorithm and would like to add on to the current functionality
of GILP. First, we will walkthough an editable installation of gilp. The
walkthough will include setting up a Python virtual enviroment for testing
and running gilp. After that, we will provide an extensive overview of the
gilp package and the modules it contains.
