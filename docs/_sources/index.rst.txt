Visualizing Linear Programs with GILP
=====================================

GILP (Geometric Interpretation of Linear Programs) is a Python package that
utilizes `Plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`_ for visualizing the geometry of
linear programs (LPs) and the simplex algorithm. It was developed for the course
`ENGRI 1101: Engineering Applications of Operations Research
<https://classes.cornell.edu/search/roster/SP20?q=engri+1101&days-type
=any&crseAttrs-type=any&breadthDistr-type=any&pi=>`_ at Cornell University.
Furthermore, it is part of the forthcoming book by David B. Shmoys, Samuel C.
Gutekunst, Frans Schalekamp, and David P. Williamson, entitled Data Science and
Decision Making: An Elementary Introduction to Modeling and Optimization.

This site contains multiple tutorials as well as the full GILP :ref:`docs`. If
you are new to `linear programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Linear_programming>`_ and the `simplex algorithm <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm>`_, we provide a breif :ref:`intro`. It
is recommended to start with the :ref:`quick` which includes installation
instructions and a tutorial. If you are interested in developing on GILP, see
:ref:`dev`. Lastly, :ref:`ex` contains mutliple example visualizations created
using GILP.

.. Potentially put some examples here.
